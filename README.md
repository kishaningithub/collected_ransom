A Twitter bot that tweets about #WannaCry ransom collections as and when it happens from across the globe

# How does this work ?

The bitcoins collected by #WannaCry goes into 3 bit coin addresses which are

- 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94
- 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw
- 115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn

When ever the money gets deposited into any of these addresses this twitter bot sends a tweet with the amount deposited and the total across all three accounts.
